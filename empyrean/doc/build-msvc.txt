How to build Empyrean with Microsoft Visual Studio.
----


Note: The only supported version of MSVS is VS.NET 2003 (VC7.1).


Get wxWindows.  Download the latest wxWindows source code release from
http://www.wxwindows.org/.  Open the .dsw file in VS.NET 2003 and
modify include/wx/msw/setup.h so that the OpenGL flag is enabled.
Just search through the file for OpenGL.  Modify your compiler
directories so wxWindows can be found.  (Tools | Options | VC++
Directories or something like that...)

The other third-party dependencies are checked into CVS, so you do not
need to worry about them.

Before you can compile or run Empyrean, you must run the
scripts/update-vc7.sh script.  This requires that you have Cygwin
installed.  When installing Cygwin, make sure you select the Python,
libpng, and jpeg packages.  (If we depend on more than that, let me
know.)

Then you need to install SCons into Cygwin.  Go to www.scons.org,
download and extract the latest source tarball into /usr/src, and run
"python setup.py install".

Finally (almost there!) you need to install Corona into Cygwin.  Go to
http://corona.sf.net/, get the latest source tarball, put it in
/usr/src (or /usr/local/src), extract it, and run "./configure && make
&& make install".  Pay attention to the output of the configure
script.  If it gives warnings about not supporting PNG or JPEG, you
need to go back and select those packages in the Cygwin installer.

Now you can open empyrean.sln and build away.  Let me know if
something doesn't work.
