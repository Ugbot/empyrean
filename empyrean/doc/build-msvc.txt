How to build Empyrean with Microsoft Visual Studio.
----


Note: The only supported version of MSVS is VS.NET 2003 (VC7.1).


Get wxWindows.  Download the latest wxWindows source code release from
http://www.wxwindows.org/.  Open the .dsw file in VS.NET 2003 and
modify include/wx/msw/setup.h so that the OpenGL flag is enabled.
Just search through the file for OpenGL.  Modify your compiler
directories so wxWindows can be found.  (Tools | Options | VC++
Directories or something like that...)

The other third-party dependencies are checked into CVS, so you do not
need to worry about them.


After downloading Empyrean from CVS, open empyrean.sln and build
away.  Let me know if something doesn't work.
