How to build Empyrean with Microsoft Visual Studio.
----


Note: The only supported version of MSVS is VS.NET 2003 (VC7.1).


Before you can compile or run Empyrean, you must run the
scripts/update-vc7.sh script.  This requires that you have Cygwin
installed.  When installing Cygwin, make sure you select the Python,
gcc (c++ and c), make, libpng-devel, and jpeg packages.  (If we depend
on more than that, let me know.)

Then you need to install SCons into Cygwin.  Go to www.scons.org,
download and extract the latest source tarball into /usr/src, and run
"python setup.py install".

Finally (almost there!) you need to install Corona into Cygwin.  Go to
http://corona.sf.net/, get the latest source tarball, put it in
/usr/src (or /usr/local/src), extract it, and run "./configure && make
&& make install".  Pay attention to the output of the configure
script.  If it gives warnings about not supporting PNG or JPEG, you
need to go back and select those packages in the Cygwin installer.

Now you can open empyrean.sln and build away.  Let me know if
something doesn't work.
