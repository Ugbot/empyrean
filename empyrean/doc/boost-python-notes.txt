If you're exporting class T with HeldType as RefPtr<T>, Boost.Python checks to
see if T has a public destructor, and fails if it doesn't.  This sucks (and is
an overzealous check in this case).  However, you can work around this by
using no_init in the class_ constructor and specifying the constructors you
want manually.
