The implementation schedule:

12/7/02 - Starting project.

12/8/02

-> Use C++ for data model, manipulation. Use wxPython for interface.
- Get a window up and running.

12/9/02

- Hello world from Python.
- Make SConstruct file.
-> scons is broken under windows.  Reinstall?
- Make makefile or batch file.
- Design document structures.
- Design actions.
- Implement Model stubs in C
- Implement View stubs in C
- Implement Anim stubs in C
- Load skeleton.

12/10/02 (2273 LOC, 64434 bytes)

- OpenGL communicating OK in C++ class through Python.
- OpenGL initializing view correctly.
- Display ground plane.
- Mouse events getting through to view correctly.

12/11/02 (2351 LOC, 66569 bytes)

- Add redraw listener support.

12/17/02 (2601 LOC, 75195 bytes)

- OpenGL scene navigation.
  - Trackball rotate.
  - Panning.
  - Zooming.
  - Visual aid?

12/18/02

- Added advanced Camera (from CS123 assignment source).
- Tried to get skeleton displaying...  Doesn't seem to be rotating correctly.

12/18/02

- Check rotation.
  -> Was interpreting quaternion xyzw (cal3d) as wxyz.
- Display skeleton.
  -> Milkshape3D models are off by 90 degrees from default cal3d models.
     Andy says it's OK to stick with the Milkshape orientation.
- Get OpenGL window working with external model drawing.

12/19/02

- Started implementation of rotation widget.

12/21/02

- Got Camera project/unproject working.

12/22/02 (3228 LOC, 92375 bytes)

- Select joint.

12/23/02 (3242 LOC, 92858 bytes)

- Improve joint drawing.

12/25/02

- Checked into CVS for first time.
- Started tool callback implementation.

12/31/02

- Make icons.

1/1/03

- Tool selection working.

--- WE ARE HERE ---

- Draw rotation widget.
- Rotation widget interaction?
- Joint drawing off by one?
- Position widget?
- Compute skeleton joint angles for current view.
- Load animation.
- Display animation.
- Design user interface.
- Get interface working with stubs.
- Edit animation.
- Save animation.
- Do some animations to make sure it all works OK.

- Load mesh?
- Display mesh?
- Some sort of text for navigation prompts?
- Add matrix-to-quaternion routine?
- Test matrix-to-quat vs. quat-to-matrix?
- Make an IQuat type?

- Set up auxilliary drawing context?
  - Initialization:
      - CreateDC
      - CreateCompatibleBitmap?
      - SelectObject?
      - wglCreateContext
  - OpenGL calls
  - Queries
  - Helpful funcs:
      - wglGetCurrentContext
      - wglGetCurrentDC
      - wglMakeCurrent
  - Deletion:
      - wglDeleteContext
      - SelectObject?
      - DeleteObject?
      - DeleteDC
  - May need to link in some other Windows libraries.
